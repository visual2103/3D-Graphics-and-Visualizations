# **MyVillage - 3D OpenGL Scene** 🌄🎮

## **Overview**
MyVillage is a **real-time 3D graphics project** built with **OpenGL, GLFW, and GLEW**. It features an interactive scene with camera movement, realistic lighting, textures, and model rendering.

## **Features** 🚀
- 🏡 **3D Scene Rendering** – A fully designed village environment  
- 🎥 **Camera System** – Smooth movement with first-person & third-person views  
- 🌌 **Skybox** – Adds depth and realism to the scene  
- 🔦 **Lighting & Shadows** – Dynamic light sources and shadow mapping  
- 📦 **OBJ Model Loading** – Uses TinyObjLoader to import `.obj` models  
- 🎨 **Texture Mapping** – Applied via `stb_image.h`  

## **Technologies Used** 🛠️
- **C++ & OpenGL** – Core graphics engine  
- **GLFW & GLEW** – Window and OpenGL extensions  
- **GLM** – Math library for transformations  
- **stb_image.h** – Image loading for textures  
- **TinyObjLoader** – For loading `.obj` 3D models  

## **Controls** 🎮
- `WASD` – Move the camera  
- `Arrow Keys` – Rotate objects  
- `Mouse` – Adjust camera view  
- `Esc` – Exit the application
